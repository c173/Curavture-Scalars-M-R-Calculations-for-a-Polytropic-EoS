# Curvature-Scalars-and-M-R-Calculations-for-an-EoS-data
This is a python code uses RK4 method with an adaptive step size to calculate the mass-radius relations, moment of inertia in slow-rotation limit and curvature scalars of a given interpolated equation of state.
Use rk4.py to calculate the M-R Relations and Curvature Scalars & Mass, Radius, Pressure of the star for a given central density.
Weyl Scalar blows up the origin since the difference of the terms inside it are too close to eachother, it will be fixed by expanding it to taylor series around the origin in the later versions.
