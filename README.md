# Curvature-Scalars-and-M-R-Calculations-for-a-Polytropic-EoS
This is a python code using arrays and RK4 method to calculate the mass-radius relations and curvature scalars of a given central density
Use rk4.py to calculate the M-R Relations and Curvature Scalars&Mass, Radius, Pressure of the star for a given central density.
You need to manually change the cutoff pressure to prevent it to get smaller than zero, adjust it as you change the central density.
